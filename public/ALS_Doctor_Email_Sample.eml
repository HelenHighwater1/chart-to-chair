    <p class="salutation">Dear [Sample Patient],</p>

    <p>
      Thank you for coming in on Thursday. I know yesterday was an incredibly difficult day, and I want to begin by saying that the courage you and your wife showed in that room - asking hard questions and engaging so thoughtfully with a lot of complex information - is something I see in the strongest patients I work with.
    </p>

    <p>
      As I promised at the end of our visit, I'm following up in writing so that you have a clear reference for everything we discussed. Please read through this carefully, and do not hesitate to reply with questions - I mean that. I review patient messages personally, and for something this important, I will respond within 24 hours on business days.
    </p>

    <div class="section-label">Understanding Your Diagnosis</div>

    <p>
      Your diagnosis is <span class="term">Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS)</span>, specifically classified as <span class="term">sporadic ALS</span> - meaning it arose without a familial or inherited cause, which is consistent with your genetic panel results (SOD1, C9orf72, FUS, and TARDBP all negative). This is the most common form, accounting for roughly 90–95% of all ALS cases.
    </p>

    <p>
      ALS is a <span class="term">progressive neurodegenerative disease</span> that affects both <span class="term">upper motor neurons (UMN)</span> - the nerve cells in your brain and brainstem that send signals downward - and <span class="term">lower motor neurons (LMN)</span> - the nerve cells in your spinal cord that carry those signals to your muscles. When both systems are simultaneously degenerating, the result is the combination of findings we identified on your examination: muscle weakness and wasting (from LMN loss) alongside brisk reflexes, a positive Babinski sign, and spasticity (from UMN loss).
    </p>

    <div class="highlight-box">
      <strong>What "Definite ALS" means:</strong> Your diagnosis meets the <em>revised El Escorial / Awaji-shima criteria</em> for Definite ALS - the highest diagnostic certainty tier. This requires combined UMN and LMN signs in at least three of four neurological regions (bulbar, cervical, thoracic, lumbosacral). Your EMG confirmed active denervation with chronic reinnervation in all four regions, which is why we were able to reach this classification at your first specialist visit rather than requiring additional observation time.
    </div>

    <p>
      I want to be direct with you about what this means, because I find patients do better when they are fully informed rather than working from uncertainty. ALS is currently <span class="term">not curable</span>, and it is progressive. The rate of progression varies considerably between individuals - some patients progress slowly over many years, while others progress more rapidly. Based on your ALSFRS-R score of 37/48, your symptom duration of approximately 14 months, and the distribution of your findings, your current rate of decline appears to be in the moderate range. We will track this carefully at every visit.
    </p>

    <p>
      That said, I also want to be clear about what ALS is <em>not</em>: it does not affect your intellect, memory, or personality (in typical cases). Your ability to think, reason, feel, and connect with the people you love is preserved. Many of my patients remain active, engaged, and purposeful for years - and that is what we are working toward together.
    </p>

    <div class="section-label">Your EMG Results - In Plain Terms</div>

    <p>
      The <span class="term">electromyography (EMG)</span> study is the most important piece of objective evidence in your workup, so I want to make sure you understand what it found. An EMG uses a fine needle electrode inserted into specific muscles to listen to their electrical activity, both at rest and during contraction.
    </p>

    <p>
      In a healthy muscle, there is electrical silence at rest. In your case, we found two abnormal patterns in multiple muscles across different parts of your body:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li><span class="term">Fibrillation potentials and positive sharp waves:</span> These are small, involuntary electrical discharges from individual muscle fibers that have lost their nerve supply. They indicate <em>active, ongoing</em> denervation - the nerve is currently dying back from that muscle. We found these in your tongue, right hand muscles, right leg, and chest paraspinal muscles.</li>
      <li><span class="term">Large, polyphasic motor unit potentials with reduced recruitment:</span> When surviving motor neurons take over the work of dead ones, they sprout new connections to orphaned muscle fibers. This makes the electrical signal from each surviving motor unit larger and more complex. The "reduced recruitment" means your nervous system cannot turn on as many motor units as it should - you're running a large building on a fraction of the normal electrical circuits.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      The fasciculations you've been seeing and feeling - those visible muscle twitches - are the surface manifestation of this same process. They are spontaneous, irregular discharges from motor neurons under stress, and they were confirmed on EMG in every region we tested.
    </p>

    <div class="section-label">Your Breathing Tests</div>

    <p>
      Your <span class="term">Forced Vital Capacity (FVC)</span> - a measure of how much air you can exhale forcefully - came back at <strong>82% of predicted</strong> when sitting upright, and <strong>75% of predicted</strong> when lying flat (supine). The drop between upright and supine is clinically significant: it suggests early involvement of the <span class="term">diaphragm</span>, your primary breathing muscle, which loses support from gravity when you lie down.
    </p>

    <div class="warning-box">
      <strong>Why this matters:</strong> Respiratory involvement is the most critical variable to monitor in ALS. We do not yet need to start non-invasive ventilation (BiPAP), but I want you to know the thresholds: we typically recommend initiating BiPAP when FVC drops below 65%, or earlier if you develop significant symptoms (morning headaches from CO<sub>2</sub> retention, waking at night short of breath, or daytime fatigue and brain fog). Please do not wait for your next scheduled visit if you notice these symptoms - contact us immediately.
    </div>

    <p>
      Your <span class="term">Peak Cough Flow (PCF)</span> of 310 L/min is below the 360 L/min threshold for an effective unassisted cough. This means that if you develop a respiratory illness, you may have difficulty clearing secretions. I have referred you to our respiratory therapy team to be fitted for a <span class="term">mechanical in-exsufflator (cough assist device)</span> - please prioritize getting this equipment in place.
    </p>

    <div class="section-label">Your Medications - Riluzole</div>

    <p>
      I have started you on <span class="term">Riluzole (Rilutek) 50mg twice daily</span>, taken with food. Riluzole is the longest-established disease-modifying treatment for ALS. It works by reducing glutamate-mediated excitotoxicity - essentially, it quiets an overactive signaling pathway that accelerates motor neuron death.
    </p>

    <p>
      I want to be honest about what the evidence shows: Riluzole extends median survival by approximately <strong>2–3 months</strong> in clinical trials. That may sound modest, but these are population averages - individual responses vary, and Riluzole is most effective when started early in the disease course, which is your situation. It is the standard of care and I recommend it unequivocally.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li><span class="term">Side effects to watch for:</span> Nausea, fatigue, and dizziness are most common in the first few weeks. Take it consistently with food and at the same times each day. Do not take with grapefruit juice (it affects drug metabolism).</li>
      <li><span class="term">Liver monitoring:</span> Riluzole can rarely cause elevated liver enzymes. I have ordered liver function tests (LFTs) at 4 weeks - this is the most important lab appointment to keep. After that, we check quarterly. If you develop jaundice, dark urine, or significant right-sided abdominal discomfort before your next labs, contact us immediately.</li>
      <li><span class="term">Cost:</span> Riluzole can be expensive. I have provided information on the Sanofi patient assistance program, and our care coordinator can help navigate this - please reach out if cost becomes a barrier.</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="section-label">The Referrals I've Placed - Please Act on These</div>

    <p>
      I've initiated the following referrals from our visit. Each of these is important, not optional:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Speech-Language Pathology (SLP):</strong> For dysarthria management and - critically - <span class="term">voice banking</span>. Your speech is still clear enough to bank a high-quality voice model that can be used later for augmentative communication. Please do this soon, through ModelTalker or VocaliD. I cannot overstate how much patients value having their own voice when they need AAC technology later.</li>
      <li><strong>Physical Therapy + AFO fitting:</strong> For your right foot drop and gait. Falls are a significant injury risk in ALS - an ankle-foot orthosis can reduce this substantially.</li>
      <li><strong>Occupational Therapy:</strong> For adaptive equipment to support your daily activities at home and at work. Your PT and OT will coordinate closely.</li>
      <li><strong>ALS Dietitian:</strong> Your 8 lb weight loss is something we take seriously. Maintaining caloric intake and muscle mass is directly linked to rate of progression - there is good evidence for this. High-calorie, high-fat diets have shown benefit in ALS patients.</li>
      <li><strong>ALS Social Work (our clinic):</strong> For you and your wife both. A diagnosis of this magnitude affects the entire family system, not just the patient. Our social worker is experienced specifically with ALS families and can help with everything from benefit navigation to emotional support resources and caregiver planning.</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="section-label">Clinical Trials - You Are a Strong Candidate</div>

    <p>
      Given that you are early in your disease course with confirmed diagnosis and good functional status, you are an excellent candidate for clinical trial participation. I want to flag two in particular:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li><span class="term">HEALEY ALS Platform Trial</span> (Massachusetts General Hospital, multi-site): An adaptive platform trial testing multiple investigational agents simultaneously. Currently enrolling. Our research coordinator will reach out to you within the week.</li>
      <li><span class="term">Investigational antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) trials:</span> While Tofersen is specific to SOD1-positive patients (which is not your case), there are several ASO trials targeting sporadic ALS pathways in active enrollment. I will send you the specific trial details separately once our research team reviews your eligibility in detail.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Participating in a trial does not mean forgoing standard care - all trials allow continuation of Riluzole and supportive therapies. I strongly encourage you to consider this, not only because you may benefit directly, but because your data contributes to understanding this disease for thousands of others.
    </p>

    <div class="section-label">A Note on Information and Support</div>

    <p>
      I want to point you toward a few resources I trust:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>ALS Association (alsa.org):</strong> The most comprehensive patient-facing organization in the US. Their local chapter can connect you with equipment loans, support groups, and care coordination.</li>
      <li><strong>Citizen Health (citizen.health):</strong> A platform I've been recommending to patients with rare and complex conditions. It allows you to consolidate and understand your medical records, connect with other ALS patients and caregivers, and - importantly - contribute your data to research in a controlled, privacy-protected way. Given how much documentation you are about to accumulate across multiple specialties, having it organized in one place will be genuinely valuable.</li>
      <li><strong>Prize4Life / Target ALS:</strong> Research-focused organizations with excellent patient resources and trial registries.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      I would also ask you to be thoughtful about what you read online. There is a great deal of well-meaning but inaccurate information about ALS on the internet, and there are unfortunately people who prey on ALS patients with unproven and expensive treatments. Please run anything you're considering by me before pursuing it.
    </p>

    <div class="section-label">What Comes Next</div>

    <p>
      Your next appointment at our <span class="term">Multidisciplinary ALS Clinic</span> is scheduled for <strong>April 10, 2025</strong>. At that visit you will see me, our pulmonologist, dietitian, SLP, PT/OT team, and social worker - all in a single half-day. These coordinated clinic days are one of the most important things we offer, and I strongly encourage you not to miss them.
    </p>

    <p>
      Before then: please keep your <strong>LFT lab appointment in 4 weeks</strong>. This is non-negotiable while you are starting Riluzole.
    </p>

    <p>
      I know this is an enormous amount to absorb. You do not need to process all of it today. What matters right now is: start your Riluzole, keep your lab appointment, and accept the referrals. Everything else we will work through together, one step at a time.
    </p>
